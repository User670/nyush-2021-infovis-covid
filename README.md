Here rests the code for a school project.

The course was Information Visualization. For the final project, we were asked to tell a narrative using visualizations of various data, and our group of three people decided to do something with New York City's COVID-19 data.

It's up to you to judge how well we've done then. (Spoiler alert: we didn't fail the course, at the very least.)

## How do I use it?
Download the repo, and put them in an HTTP web server. (It doesn't work if you simply double-clicked the html.)
